          Leadership
          <p>
            At OmniSci I was nominated to be a Team Lead. I led several projects
            to build new features - handling both project management tasks as
            well as contributing to the code. I led the team’s retrospectives,
            and facilitated feedback between our team and all levels of
            management (including our CEO). I also led our bi-weekly Engineering
            Demo meetings, where I coordinated presenting new product features
            to the company. Lastly, I worked to coordinate a company-wide
            on-call system to improve triaging of critical bugs and cross-team
            communication.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Communication
          <p>
            I do my best to provide prompt, empathetic, and humble communication
            with everyone at my company. It's also my passion to write
            easily-readble, well-documented code. Additionally, the VP of
            Marketing at OmniSci called my presentation skills “fantastic”.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Attention to detail
          <p>
            At my current company, my boss commended my tendency to "leave
            things better than I found them".
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Culture building
          <p>
            At Omnisci, I had a strong impact on building a positive culture: I
            founded and ran our Mario Kart night - we met twice weekly for over
            5 months and attracted people from all over the company. I also led
            an initiative to have a coordinated team Halloween costume, which
            won our company’s costume prize. Additionally, I frequently
            facilitated social meetings with my coworkers - including one that
            continues to meet long after I've left the company.

            <p>
              I led an initiative to rebuild a suite of outdated applications.
              Notably, I built an Angular-based UI component library.

            <p>
              I also led an initiative to internationalize our Angular app. This

              internationalization alongside new app development.
