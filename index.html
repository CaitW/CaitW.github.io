        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>
          At OmniSci I was nominated to be a Team Lead. I led several projects
          to build new features - handling both project management tasks as well
          as contributing to the code. I led the team’s retrospectives, and
          facilitated feedback between our team and all levels of management
          (including our CEO). I also led our bi-weekly Engineering Demo
          meetings, where I coordinated presenting new product features to the
          company. Lastly, I worked to coordinate a company-wide on-call system
          to improve triaging of critical bugs and cross-team communication.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>
          I do my best to provide prompt, empathetic, and humble communication
          with everyone at my company. It's also my passion to write
          easily-readble, well-documented code. Additionally, the VP of
          Marketing at OmniSci called my presentation skills “fantastic”.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Culture building</h3>
        <p>
          At Omnisci, I had a strong impact on building a positive culture: I
          founded and ran our Mario Kart night - we met twice weekly for over 5
          months and attracted people from all over the company. I also led an
          initiative to have a coordinated team Halloween costume, which won our
          company’s costume prize. Additionally, I frequently facilitated social
          meetings with my coworkers - including one that continues to meet long
          after I've left the company.

        <blockquote>
          One thing that I appreciate (and our team appreciates) is that Caitlin
          takes time 'to leave a place better than she found it.' As she is
          working, she regularly takes time to refactor existing code for the
          better or if the changes are too far off her current track, then she
          will file a JIRA with breadcrumbs.
        </blockquote>
        <cite>&#8211; VP of Platform Engineering at Ridgeline</cite>

        <blockquote>
          Caitlin’s strong technical background enabled her to come up to speed
          quickly, and she continues to produce high quality PRs that impress
          her peers.
        </blockquote>
        <cite>&#8211; VP of Platform Engineering at Ridgeline</cite>
        <blockquote>
          Caitlin has been really selfless with her time helping the [team]
          discover new Grid offerings and understand how to implement new
          features. I am personally in awe of the way Caitlin has been handling
          feature requests from Product teams. She is never phased by our
          complex asks. Grids are some of the most (if not the most) complicated
          Platform offerings, and Caitlin has been an awesome captain [...]. She
          has been a great partner to our team.
